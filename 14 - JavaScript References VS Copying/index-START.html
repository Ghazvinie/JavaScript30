    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let num1 = 1;
    let num2 = num1;
    console.log(num1, num2);

    num1 = 2;
    console.log(num1, num2);

    let str1 = 'dan';
    let str2 = str1;
    console.log(str1, str2);

    str1 = 'han';
    console.log(str1, str2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    let newTeam = Array.from(players);
    let newerTeam = [...players];
    team[0] = 'dan';
    console.log(players,team)

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    console.log(newTeam, newerTeam);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      bitMore : {
          another : 'thing',
          lastly : 'this'
      }
    };

    let person2 = person;
    let person3 = Object.assign({},person);
    let person4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    console.log(person, person2);
    person.name = 'dan';
    person3.dob = '1808';

    person3.bitMore.another = 'bab';
    console.log(person,person2, person3, person4);

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
